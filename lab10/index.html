		<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<p>Wednesday November 2, 2022</p>

		<div id="sect-1">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="sect-2">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had a lot of trouble understanding the input field. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be made with a prompt, like in a lecture, or with a window like in Lab 7. I eventually used W3Schools to figure out there is an HTML form field  element which you can also label. Later, I kept getting a JavaScript "null is not an object" error and I had no idea how to solve it. At this point, my code was messy and unreadable so I started from scratch and didn't get that error again.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

				<input type="text" id="user-name">
				<button id="my-button">Submit</button>

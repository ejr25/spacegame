				<h2>About the Game</h2>
				<p>This game is the first in a series I'll be creating for my senior class, ARTG170. Our first assignment was to create an anthology of minigames “inspired by the works of instruction art in the Fluxus tradition”. My team chose the theme “universe” and took inspiration from Grapefruit by Yoko Ono. My goal with this game was to have people first interact with the world around them, and then proceed to create something new with what they saw.</p>
				<h2>About the Author</h2>
				<p>My name is Emma Radichkova and I am a senior AGPM major at UCSC. I have minimal coding experience, and have never created a game from start to finish on my own before; this is my very first solo, coding project!</p>
